Commit Validation is an emerging topic on the area of Software Quality methods which can significantly reduce costs by reducing development effort and faults by finding and fixing them early when they are introduced. While many varying tools and research publications have been published on this topic, a clear State of the Art approach has not been defined yet, and new methods continue to emerge. 
The goal of this paper is to explore how Commit Validation techniques can be compared in an objective way as well as reporting on how to find suitable a Commit Validation technique for a Software Engineering project.
In an effort to satisfy this goal, five relevant Commit Validation have been selected and analyzed: CLEVER, Commit Guru, Unusual Commits, Deeper and an unnamed method by Kamei et. al.
Contributions of this paper include the proposal of an objective evaluation schema for Commit Validation methods, the analysis of the five approaches and an evaluation of this comparison.
